# rbf-tools

This will be a small collection of python programs associated with radial basis function interpolation.

I am planning to include the following things: Interpolation on the sphere, interpolation on the Euclidean space, Lebesgue constants, various visualisations.

Most of these are based the libraries numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Occasionally I will use sympy.
