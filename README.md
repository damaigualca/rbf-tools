# rbf-tools

This is a small collection of functions associated with radial basis function interpolation and collocation.

I am planning to include the following things:

	- interpolation on the sphere

	- interpolation on the Euclidean space

	- Lebesgue constants

	- various visualisations

Most of these are based the libraries numpy, scipy and matplotlib. Occasionally I will use sympy.
